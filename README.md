# Key Features:

**Data Preparation**: Extracts relevant features from historical stock data.

**Model Training**: Trains a linear regression model to predict closing prices.

**Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using mean squared error and R-squared score.

**Model Saving**: Saves the trained model for future use.

**Trading Strategy**: Implements a simple trading strategy based on the model's predictions.

# Getting Started:

**Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

**Prepare Data**: Load your historical stock data into a Pandas DataFrame.

**Train Model**: Run the code provided in the model_training.py script to train the linear regression model.

**Evaluate Model**: Analyze the model's performance metrics to assess its effectiveness.

**Implement Trading Strategy**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data and execute trades based on those predictions.

# Prerequisites:

Python 3.x 

Pandas library

scikit-learn library

joblib library

# Disclaimer:

Trading stocks involves significant financial risks and is not suitable for all investors. This project provides a basic framework for stock price prediction and trading strategy implementation, but it does not guarantee profits. Use this information at your own discretion.

# Installation:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
 
              git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated_stock_trading_ml_model.git

2. Install the required Python libraries:
 
              pip install -r requirements.txt
# Usage:

1. Run the trading script:
 
              python automated_stock_trading_ml_model.py

2. The script will pull historical forex data for a particular stock, train the Linear Regression model, and start placing trades automatically based on the model's predictions.
